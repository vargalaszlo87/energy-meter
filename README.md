# Energy-Meter

This project is an industrial embedded project to test and monitor three-phase networks and devices.

## Features
In this case, we are only taling about the embedded-software features:

- Calculating all important electrical parameters
- Analysing transient and steady-state 
- Advanced signal regeneration (for calc etc.) 
- Interfaces to the world
